title: "Common Comparative Tropes - Flexibility in Civil and Common Law Systems"
description: "The blogpost will examine how early comparative law practice helped spread certain tropes and stereotypes about different legal systems. In particular it will examine the still widely held belief, that Common Law systems, in which judges are able to create precedent to fit new facts, are more flexible than Civil Law systems in which judges supposedly must mechanically apply a written code or 'rulebook'. Taking the example of English and German Law, this blogpost will give an historical overview of this common legal myth and see how it holds up today."

The German legal system, with its overattachment to dogma, doorstop legal codes, and obsession with the rulebook, is inevitably far more inflexible than the pragmatic and time honoured tradition of English Common Law, right? Opinions like these have been kicking around since at least the First International Congress of Comparative Law in Paris 1900, and probably a lot longer than that. The narrative of Civil Law rigidity is woven into the nationalist DNA of the UK’s legal identity. While the French at the 1900 Congress were boasting about their Code's "logic," [^1]  English contemporaries like Pollock (in his 1911 lectures The Genius of the Common Law) were, unsurprisingly given the title,  singing the praises of "Our Lady" (the common law) —a system that was superior because it was not "frozen" in a code but lived in the "fearless and independent" minds of judges. [^2]

These kinds of jingoistic takes on comparative law still make for entertaining discussions when lawyers from different countries get together and start poking fun at each other. Comparative law scholarship today, has thankfully moved beyond the headstrong days of the Paris congress. It is nevertheless occasionally worth taking a closer look at some of these antiquated charaterisations of foreign legal systems. If anything because it can deepen our grasp of the underlying style of legal reasoning that these kinds of nationalistic tropes - clumsy as they are - originally sought to explain. 

A classic case study of the 'Civil Law rigidity vs Common Law pragmatism' myth can be done by comparing the legal systems of Germany and the United Kingdom. Germany undertook one of the most ambitions projects of legal rationalisation at the beginning of the 20th century with the famous Civil Code (the Bürgerliche Gesetzbuch or BGB) coming into force on the 1st of January 1900. [^3] The codification of German Law nationally was a great undertaking and symbolic of German unification which of 1871. [^4]. This philosophy of legal rationalisation can take on almost poetic dimensions. The BGB quite literally starts at the beginning of life (the legal capacity of a human starting with birth under § 1) and ends with death (the last part of the BGB being inheritance law starting at § 1922 ). [^5] As a law nerd I love this. 

German legal reform of this era was all about consistency across the newly unified empire and public trust - or more specifically business confidence - in the legal system. This was achieved by doing away with regional differences and ensuring commercial disputes could be settled though a comprehensive, consistently applied, and non arbitrary framework. Max Weber famous described the German Legal System of the time as one possessing a "logically formal rationality." As Trubek explains, this highlights how the specialised analysis of abstract legal rues used in legal decision making creates a high degree of predictability important to the emerging industrial capitalism of the period. [^6] To a jurist trained in the common law system however, a comprehensive Civil Law code like the BGB essentially amounts to a great big rule book which impossibly attempts to account for every conceivable contingency. The connotation might be negative, but this basic idea of German law is actually a good starting point. The crucial caveat however, is in understanding how German jurists are trained and the unique legal methodology they employ to apply the legal code to a given case. 

This methodology, known as the *Gutachtenstil* mandates the following steps: A: *Obersatz* (introductory sentence) B: *Definition* (abstractly defining the applicable legal requirement) C: *Subsumtion* (applying the law to the given facts, where the law is 'argued' and 'interpreted') and D: *Konklusion* (conclusion, final answer to the legal problem) [^7]. This methodology could be subject to an entire blogpost by itself, but a few things to keep in mind are that it employs a logical flow from the abstract to the concrete facts, and that it is completely granular. Granular here means that the *Gutachtenstil* is not only used for the whole overarching case, but also applied to any necessary sub-headings. The four step process is recursively employed for every constituent legal requirement implicated in the case until eventually a final verdict is reached.[^8] 

Now all this might sound like more dogma piled onto an already rigid system, however it does in some respects give a remarkable amount of flexibility to German jurists in how they apply the law. Let's explore this through a few examples which will hopefully do away with a few Anglo-Saxon myths about German law.
