title: "Common Comparative Tropes - Flexibility in Civil and Common Law Systems"
description: "The blogpost will examine how early comparative law practice helped spread certain tropes and stereotypes about different legal systems. In particular it will examine the still widely held belief, that Common Law systems, in which judges are able to create precedent to fit new facts, are more flexible than Civil Law systems in which judges supposedly must mechanically apply a written code or 'rulebook'. Taking the example of English and German Law, this blogpost will give an historical overview of this common legal myth and see how it holds up today."

The German legal system, with its overattachment to dogma, doorstop legal codes, and obsession with the rulebook, is inevitably far more inflexible than the pragmatic and time honoured tradition of English Common Law, right? Opinions like these have been kicking around since at least the First International Congress of Comparative Law in Paris 1900, and probably a lot longer than that. The narrative of Civil Law rigidity is woven into the nationalist DNA of the UK’s legal identity. While the French at the 1900 Congress were boasting about their Code's "logic," [^1]  English contemporaries like Pollock (in his 1911 lectures The Genius of the Common Law) were, unsurprisingly given the title,  singing the praises of "Our Lady" (the common law) —a system that was superior because it was not "frozen" in a code but lived in the "fearless and independent" minds of judges. [^2]

These kinds of jingoistic takes on comparative law still make for entertaining discussions when lawyers from different countries get together and start poking fun at each other. Comparative law scholarship today however, has thankfully moved far far beyond the headstrong days of the Paris congress. It is nevertheless occasionally worth taking a closer look at some of these antiquated charaterisations of foreign legals systems. If anything because it can deepen our grasp of the underlying style of legal reasoning that these kinds of nationalistic tropes - clumsy as they are - originally sought to explain. 

A classic case study of 'Civil Law rigidity' vs 'Common Law pragmatism' would be Germany and the United Kingdom. Germany undertook one of the most ambitions projects of legal rationalisation at the beginning of the 20th century with the famous Civil Code (the Bürgerliche Gesetzbuch or BGB) coming into force on the 1st of January 1900. [^3] The codification of German Law nationally was a great undertaking and symbolic of German unification which had only finished in 1871.
