title: "Common Comparative Tropes - Flexibility in Civil and Common Law Systems"
description: "The blogpost will examine how early comparative law practise helped spread certain tropes and stereotypes about different legal systems. In particuar it will examine the still widely held belief, that Common Law systems, in which judges are able to create precident to fit new facts, are more flexible than Civil Law systems in which judges supposedly must mechanically apply a written code or 'rulebook'. Taking the example of English and German Law, this blogpost will give an historical overview of this common legal myth and see how it holds up today."

The German legal system, with its overattachment to dogma, doorstop legal codes, and obsession with the rulebook, is inevitably far more inflexible than the pragmatic dynamism of English Common Law, right? Opionions like these have been kicking around since at least the The First International Congress of Comparative Law in Paris 1900, and probably a lot longer than that. The narrative of Civil Law rigidity is woven into the nationalist DNA of the UK’s legal identity. While the French at the 1900 Congress were boasting about their Code's "logic," [^1]English contemporaries like Pollock (in his 1911 lectures The Genius of the Common Law) were, unsurprisingly given the title,  singing the praises of "Our Lady" (the common law) —a system that was superior because it was not "frozen" in a code but lived in the "fearless and independent" minds of judges.
